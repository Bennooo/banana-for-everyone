## Suggestions and Bug Reports
Should be recorded by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/Bennooo/banana-for-everyone/issues/new/choose).
Keep in mind that this is a passion project above anything else, and the devs aren't guaranteed to add every feature.
If you are submitting a bug report, be concise and clear about what causes the issue.

## Personal Note From Ben:
This started off as a passion project just for me and Necro, and I think itâ€™s insane how far this actually went. From a meteor prefix to a skid to finally a masterpiece. Thank you all for supporting this project, shits unreal! Sad that this shit happened tho.

B+ on top, All love <3 -ben
